For example `⌘` + `Left Arrow` is usually the same as `Home`\n(go to beginning of current line) but that doesn't work in the shell.  Home works in many apps but it\ntakes you away from the home row.\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nMove to the start of line | `Ctrl` + `A` or `Home`\nMove to the end of line | `Ctrl` + `E` or `End`\nSet Mark | `⌘` + `M`\nJump to Mark | `⌘` + `J`\n\n### Enabling Natural Text Editing\n\n* Go to **Preferences**... > **Profiles** > **Keys**\n* Press **Load Preset**...\n* Select **Natural Text Editing**\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nMove forward a word | `Option` + `->`\nMove backward a word | `Option` + `<-`\nDelete a word backwards | `Option` + `Delete`\n\n## Copy and Paste with iTerm without using the mouse\n\nI don't use this feature too much.\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nEnter Copy Mode | `Shift` + `⌘` + `C`\nEnter Character Selection Mode in Copy Mode | `Ctrl` + `V`\nMove cursor in Copy Mode | `HJKL` vim motions or arrow keys\nCopy text in Copy Mode | `Ctrl` + `K`\nView clipboard | `Command` + `Shift` + `H`\n\nCopy actions goes into the normal system clipboard which you can paste like normal.\n\n\n## Search the Command History\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nSearch as you type | `Ctrl` + `R` and type the search term; Repeat `Ctrl` + `R` to loop through result\nSearch the last remembered search term | `Ctrl` + `R` twice\nEnd the search at current history entry  | `Ctrl` + `Y`\nCancel the search and restore original line | `Ctrl` + `G`\n\n## Misc\n\n**Function** | **Shortcut**\n-------- | --------\nBroadcast command to all panes in window (nice when needed!) | `⌘` + `Alt` +  `I` (again to toggle)\nView files in current directory | `Ctrl` + `I`"
